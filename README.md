# Parent App 

An Android app that makes it *somewhat* easier to have children! 

This is a project developed in the class of CMPT 276-Introduction to Software Engineering at Simon Fraser University.

## Features

* Flip a Coin

  Have a hard time deciding something? Try flipping a random coin to produce a result just like in real life. You can also view the history to see your trend.

* Meditative Breathing Practice:

  Sometimes both parents and children need to relax. This feature helps you to calm down by following a breathing exercise.

* Timer:

  Easy tracking how long your children have been doing an activity. 

* Task Tracker:

  Allow you to keep track of which child's turn it is for daily matters.

## Installation

Download the project, open it in Android Studio, and then run the app using the build-in Android simulator.
